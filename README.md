<h1>❓ What is Easy Newsroom</h1>
<p>Easy Newsroom is a piece of software that allows site owners to easily create a news section on their website by setting up the front end and the back end on a Linux machine. The website owner will set up the front end on a web server and set up the back end on the same machine or a different one if they want.</p>

<h1>⚙️ How Does it Work</h1>
<p>Easy Newsroom works by having two parts. The front end (built in React), and the back end (built in Python). The website owner will set up the React app on a web server and configure it with the URL to communicate with the backend. They will also set up the back end on a Linux machine and configure it with the login credentials, domain, etc.</p>

<h1>🔥 Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li>🔒 HTTPS encryption between front and back end.</li>
